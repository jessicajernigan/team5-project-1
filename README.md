## User Stories

### I.
As an amateur bartender at home, I want to find directions and inspiration for new cocktail recipes that are easy to use on desktop, tablet, and phone. 

### II. 
As an indecisive consumer trying to decide on the perfect cocktail recipe, I want to toggle through my previous search terms while I narrow down my choices, so I need an application that will save my previous search terms even after Iâ€™ve reloaded the page.

### III. 
As a bored captive of quarantine, I want to liven things up with new cocktail recipes, so I want an app that will return some new and interesting results based on my search preferences.
